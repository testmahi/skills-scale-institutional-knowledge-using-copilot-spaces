## OctoAcme Project Management Processes Summary

Our project management approach is organized into the following key phases:

- **Initiation:** Define project goals, stakeholders, and success criteria using one-pager templates and checklists. Establish clear objectives and alignment before work begins.

- **Planning:** Break work into shippable increments, estimate effort, define milestones, prioritize backlog, and visualize progress through project boards. Create realistic timelines and allocate resources effectively.

- **Execution & Tracking:** Use GitHub Projects for task management, daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, regular demos, and defined PR conventions. Emphasize testing and quality gates via CI to maintain high standards throughout development.

- **Risk & Communication:** Maintain a risk register, follow structured communication templates, and escalate blockers as per standard paths. Proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact delivery.

- **Release & Deployment:** Adhere to documented checklists for releasing, incident response, rollback, and stakeholder announcements. Ensure smooth, reliable deployments with clear rollback procedures.

- **Retrospective & Improvement:** Run regular retros, capture action items, and integrate improvements into process docs. Continuously learn and adapt based on team feedback and outcomes.

- **Roles & Personas:** Clear responsibilities for Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders—for transparency and alignment. Ensure everyone understands their role and how they contribute to success.
